# Poxviruses-Genomics
Evolution of Poxviruses, With the aim of targeting Druggable genes.
# Genomic Analysis of Poxviridae Family (1994â€“2024)

This repository contains data, scripts, and results from our comprehensive genomic study of 10 poxviruses across a 31-year period (1994â€“2024). We retrieved, processed, and analyzed complete viral genome sequences to assess quality metrics, genomic diversity, and potential evolutionary trends.

## ðŸ“‘ Summary

We conducted a large-scale retrieval and analysis of viral genome sequences from the Poxviridae family using NCBI E-utilities and various bioinformatics tools. This work focused on genome integrity, sequence quality, GC content, duplication levels, and ambiguous nucleotide composition.
